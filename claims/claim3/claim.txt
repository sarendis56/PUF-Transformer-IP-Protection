Claim 3: Robustness to Retraining Attacks

This is for table 3 in the paper.

- Demonstration: retraining attack on the obfuscated DeiT-tiny model using the 
20%/50% CIFAR-100 training set. The results will show that the retrained model's 
accuracy remains noticeably lower than the original, non-obfuscated model, just as 
the paper shows in Table 3.
