Claim 5: Robustness of our ACM+permutation encryption against key-guessing attacks

This claim demonstrates that the dual encryption scheme (Arnold Cat Map + permutation matrices)
provides robust security against various key-guessing attack scenarios. The analysis consists
of four comprehensive experiments that validate different aspects of the encryption's security.
This is for the figure 6 and table 6 in the paper. We also include some experiments that are
not presented in the paper due to page limit.

- Demonstration:

1. ACM Key Sensitivity Analysis (Figure 6a)
   - Tests how sensitive the encrypted model is to variations in Arnold Cat Map keys
   - Generates multiple valid ACM key variants from a base key
   - Encrypts attention weights with each key variant using dual encryption
   - Evaluates accuracy degradation for each key to measure sensitivity
   - Validates that small key changes cause significant accuracy drops, making brute-force attacks difficult

2. Permutation Sensitivity Analysis
   - Tests the sensitivity of the dual encryption scheme to different permutation matrices
   - Generates multiple permutation matrices using various random seeds
   - Applies permutations to FFN weights within the dual encryption scheme
   - Evaluates accuracy degradation for each permutation variant
   - Validates that different permutation matrices provide consistent security guarantees
   - Measures permutation intensity (number of displaced elements) and its correlation with accuracy drops

3. Dual Encryption Security Analysis
   - Evaluates security against partial key recovery attacks
   - Tests three scenarios:
     a) Original model (no encryption) - baseline performance
     b) Dual encrypted model (both ACM + permutation) - fully encrypted performance
     c) Key guessing attacks where attacker knows one key and guesses the other
   - Measures whether partial key knowledge provides significant advantage
   - Validates that knowing one key type doesn't help with attacking the other

4. Decrypt One Layer Analysis (Table 6)
   - Tests whether correctly decrypting a single layer provides significant accuracy improvements, giving hints for complete decryption of the model
   - Starts with fully encrypted model across multiple layers
   - Decrypts individual layers one at a time with correct keys
   - Measures accuracy improvement from each single-layer decryption
   - Simulates extreme scenario where attacker correctly guesses keys for one specific layer
   - Validates that decrypting any single layer yields only minimal accuracy gains (< 1%)
