Claim 1: Drastic Accuracy Drop

The proposed obfuscation method scrambles weights, an effect that is independent of model size.
This is for table 2 in the paper.

- Demonstration: Encrypt a few layers of the fine-tuned DeiT-tiny model. The accuracy 
on the CIFAR-100 test set drops from a high baseline (e.g., >90%) to approximately 
1% (random guess), just as it did on ImageNet.
